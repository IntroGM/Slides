<h3>What is the idea?</h3>

<p align="left">
  We'd like to see you take your new skills as geodynamic modellers and apply them to learning something about a problem of your choosing.
</p>

<p align="left">
Example problems could include:
<ul>
    <li>Rifting of a continent</li>
    <li>Continent-continent collision</li>
    <li>Intrusion of igneous bodies in 1D or 2D</li>
    <li>Sinking of tectonic plates in the mantle</li>
  </ul>
</p>
             </script>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
### What do you need to do?

For the project you should design a model, run 1-3 numerical experiments with your model, and write a short paper describing the model and your results in the format of a scientific journal article

## The paper
            </script>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Format</h3>
            <p align="left">
              The paper should be formatted as follows
              
              <ul>
                <li>12 pt Times New Roman (or similar) font</li>
                <li>Single spacing between lines</li>
                <li>Text and figures should not exceed 8 pages</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>References and the appendix can be on additional pages as needed</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p align="left">
              The paper should include the sections described on the following slides
            </p>

### Abstract

- A one-paragraph summary of the exercise and your results
            </script>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
### Introduction

- Clearly describe the problem you are addressing (or hypothesis being tested) and it's significance
- Provide background information on the topic (e.g., from lecture notes and other sources)
- Provide 1 short paragraph about how your models relate to understanding your stated problem.
- 2-4 paragraphs in length
            </script>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
### Methods

- Clearly state the equations being solved and the different methods used in solving the equations
- List the main variables or free parameters in the equations
- This should be more than 1 paragraph in length
            </script>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
### Results

- This part describes the results from your experiments
- Include selected figures from the output of your model with figure captions describing the results
- You should have at least 1 paragraph of text that describes each figure

**Note**: The results section should only contain observations that resulted from your experiment.
No interpretations of the results should be included in this section.

              <ul>
                <li>This part of the report discusses your results. It can have multiple subsections if you desire. Any interpretation you make from your plots/calculations should be presented here.</li>
                <li>An example discussion section topics (at least one paragraph each) could include:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>What are the main geological or geophysical implications of your results?</li>
                  <li>Was there any result that was unexpected or counterintuitive?</li>
                  <li>What are the limitations of the modeling approach and how do they affect the results?</li>
                  <li>What are the implications of your results for the problem/hypothesis you stated in the introduction? Have you sufficiently tested your hypothesis or are more experiments needed?</li>
                  <li>Any other topics you feel should be discussed about the implications of the model results</li>
                </ul>
